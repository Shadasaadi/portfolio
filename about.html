            I studied Neuroscience at Tel Tel-Aviv university
            Before that I studied medicine for a year and a half in the technion institute in haifa ( I graduated
            highschool at 17 because I skipped a class in elementary school so I was able to get accepted at 19 ) .
            I have done a couple of math courses on the side in the open university ( algebra and calculus for cs
            students)
            Im intrested in the human brain , how does function and what does the future holds for us mostly in the
            AI (artificial intelligence) feild .
            On a less serious note- im so into the music industry that I even learned a little bit of audio
            processing myself I play a bit of guitar and my singing is not too shappy .

               <h3> Ein-Ibrahim</h3>
               <p>I was born and raised in Ein Ibrahim till the age of 19 , it's a very peacful village\neighborhood ,
                  a quite one too. so many childhood memories lies between it's alleys and it will always hold a
                  special place in my heart .

               <h3> Tel Aviv </h3>
               <p> I have been living in Tel-Aviv since I left for university at the age of 20 , I can definitely say
                  that I love this city for the diversity it holds within , for the cool memories i made here , and
                  most and foremost for the poeple which I love that I met here .

               <h3> Canada </h3>
               <p>Regarding the Places which I would like to live in\visit , Canada would be great . I have a couple of
                  really good friends who live there and from what I have heard the people there are very friendly and
                  it's just a nice place in general, so anywhere in Canada would be a nice place to live, not to
                  mention that my favorite band peforms there all the time , what more can I ask for ?

               <h3> Japan </h3>
               <p> I'm a huge anime fan and such a “weeb” , so it's easy to guess that that I would love to visit japan
                  for a while, preferably anywhere near chidorigafuchi park or ueno park , because of the lovely views
                  and the cherry blossoms in the spring ,that and obviously to learn more about the culture up close ,
                  visit the monuments, and ofcurse to enjoy their real ethnic food
                  .
